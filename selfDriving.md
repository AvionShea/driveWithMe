### Built with

- JavaScript
- HTML
- Canvas

### What I learned

I learned how to implement the car driving mechanics, define the environment, simulate sensors, detect collisions, and how to make the car control itself using neural network.

```html
<h1>Some JavaScript code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```js
#getReading(ray, roadBorders, traffic){
        let touches = [];

        for(let i=0; i <roadBorders.length; i++){
            const touch = getIntersection(
                ray[0],
                ray[1],
                roadBorders[i][0],
                roadBorders[i][1]
            );
```

I learned about private class features within JavaScript. Private methods are dictated by using a # prefix. Private class features can not be accessed outside of the function they are used in.

### Continued development

I want to continue with focusing on other aspects of JavaScript.
